/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  BNI WINNING EDGE — SITE CONTENT
 * ============================================================================
 *  This is the file you touch every Friday. It holds the chapter info, this
 *  week's meeting recap, and the upcoming speaker rotation.
 *
 *  The member directory and leadership team are NOT in this file — they
 *  live in the member database, data/members.js (kept in sync with BNI by
 *  `python3 scripts/sync-bni.py`; edit it directly for anything BNI doesn't
 *  have, like a missing company link or an email).
 *
 *  HOW TO UPDATE EACH WEEK
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  1. Open the weekly BNI email (the .oft/.eml Outlook file, or whatever
 *     Friday recap you send out).
 *  2. Update the `thisWeek` block (meetingDateLabel, trophyNote,
 *     speakers, announcements), the `quote`, and the `palms` report (see
 *     its comment). `announcements` is a list of short lines, one bullet
 *     each; use [] to hide the Announcements card.
 *     The trophy winner itself is picked in data/members.js: move
 *     "trophyWinner": true to the winner's record (false on everyone else).
 *  3. Add new speaker dates to the bottom of `rotation`. Past dates are
 *     hidden on the site automatically, so deleting old rows is optional
 *     housekeeping.
 *  4. Save. Refresh the browser tab. That's it — no build step.
 *
 *  SPEAKERS — you only need `name` and `company`.
 *  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Their photo and company link are looked up automatically by matching
 *  `name` against the member database (data/members.js), so most
 *  weeks that's all you type. If a speaker is a visitor/not a chapter
 *  member (so there's nothing to match), you can add `photo` and
 *  `companyUrl` directly here and they'll be used as-is.
 * ============================================================================
